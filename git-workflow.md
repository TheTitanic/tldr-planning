Clone & push directly to branches, merge branches via PR. PRs get merged in by team decision.

`master` => production branch
`develop` => development branch
feature branching, merging into `develop`; `hotfix` and `refactor` branches to resolve issues from merges

If more than one person is working on a feature branch, create a separate branch called `branchname-personname` to indicate your specific work.
